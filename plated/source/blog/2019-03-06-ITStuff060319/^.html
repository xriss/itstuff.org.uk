<span>BCB IT Stuff recording 6 March 2019 transmission 7/8 March 2019</span>

<span>[0] Hello folks and welcome to IT Stuff</span>, it's March 2019 and you might have noticed this week is International Women's Day Week so on behalf of the equality armageddon of tech let us be the first to wish you a very happy International Women's Day Week Month. Bro.

Welcome back Shi and Kriss. And my name is Momo, and I've got bulging eyes, I'm not a thing. Something that is a thing is throwing cheese slices at babies on the youtubes. Mumsnet does not approve... they had a bit of a cockup on the security front, a few weeks ago people found they could view other peoples' accounts, PMs etc. 46 accounts breached. They've got form but at least they're not Facebook.

<span>[3 Min] Don't be evil</span> [EVIL] This month's special guest evil is Amazon! Welcome! So, what about the Amazon Ring? The Ring is a security camera, can you guess where this is going? Not only did the Ring development team have full access to your security video but so did random Amazon bosses to watch who they wanted live on demand. No evidence they did, but! And then there's the features like their Neighbourhood watch, which relies on actual people in Ukraine watching live and drawing boxes round people and things to tag in real time.

Also they are having a scrap with the River Amazon over dot amazon TLD

<span>[6 Min] Cryptocurrency news</span> There's a dirt cheap smartphone coming called the Electronium M1 -- it's cheap because it mines Electroneum tokens that you can use to top up etc. Er it's also cheap because it's a cheap rubbishy phone. And also there are indications that Facebook is about to launch its own cryptocurrency. What could possibly? btw Bitcoin is up a smidge!

<span>[9 Min] Something we haven't mentioned much</span> is the Great British Porn Ban, going to happen in a month or 2. People aren't aware of it. Of all the things that need fixing -- fake news, hate and harassment, knife crime, industrial strategy, climate change, your loving Government has prioritised stopping under 18s from seeing any kind of smut. So if you want to waste your life on porn you'll either have to give your credit card deets to porn sites or go to a petrol station and pay them a tenner – genius! or get an offshore VPN.

The BBFC is in charge, they're refusing to consult on technical standards for age verification and privacy. It's got all the makings of a disaster.

<span>[12 Min] And now a very important moment.</span> Peak IT Stuff. Nike Smart Trainers are a thing. The Nike Adapt BB is a 309 quid self lacing trainer. It's got a Bluetooth app that allows you to adjust tightness and the led lights. But Mr Nike sent out a duff firmware update and bricked peoples' sneakers. "my left shoe won't even reboot"

<span>[14 Min] You're listening to IT Stuff dot 106 point fm dot six dot uk point org dot 106 dot stuff.</span> Public service announcement! If you've got a free Flickr account with more than 1000 photos you've got until 12 March to save the excess somewhere before they get deleted forever. 

<span>[15 Min] World of Stuff</span> [WORLDOFSTUFF] Azure Kinect is a new version of the Kinect back from the dead, so it's a computer vision camera that can use clever maths to reconstruct a 3d scene. The new version is all round more powerful, lots of sensors so it's not just computer vision, maybe a bit pricey for just gaming but more capable for things like art installations, or manufacturing. 

<span>[17 Min] Singularity Watch</span> [SINGULARITY] So where are we with brain implants? Er we should have a trigger warning. Researchers have already demonstrated deep brain implants in rats that can control rats' movements in a maze (left/right/forward/back). Other researches have demonstrated the limited ability to read simple thoughts in humans.

So put them together... yep it's 2019 and remote controlled mindreading cyborg rats are a thing at the Department of Computer Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China: “integrated electroencephalogram-based motor imagery and brain stimulation to realize human mind control of the rat’s continuous locomotion”

<span>[20 Min] AI news</span> The Elon Musk firm OpenAI had a brilliant moment of marketing hype when they announced their thing is so good at faking text that it's too dangerous to release. To be fair it does have serious implications and we're not really ready for a tidal wave of computer generated fake reviews etc.

<span>[22 Min] Local events</span> There's Badonkadonk on Wed 13 March, Bradlug on Tue 12 March and CoderDojo at the end of this month Sat 30 March. You can register for the February dojo at bradford-coderdojo.github.io, or possiby even send them a pull request on the githubs fixing that.

<span>[24 Min] Back in the world of Elon Musk</span> It's been a quiet month, well except for him being up for contempt of court, it's the usual, he tweeted something iffy about Tesla. Last time round it cost him 12 Million for misleading the stock market. This time?

<span>[25 Min] To play us out</span> shiru8bit: “System Beeps is a music album in form of an MS-DOS program that features my original music composed for PC Speaker. You can run it on any MS-DOS compatible machine with 8088 or better, and listen to some music in the glorious monophonic square wave.”
