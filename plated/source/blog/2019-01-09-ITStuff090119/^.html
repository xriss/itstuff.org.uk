<span>BCB IT Stuff recording 9 January 2019 transmission 10/11 January 2019</span>

<span>[0] Howdy Ho, this is IT Stuff</span>, we are here to tell you that Christmas is over. Happy new year, as Huawei tweeted from iPhones, shortly before the employees were demoted. Here’s Kriss and Shi.

<span>[2 Min] We normally start with Dont Be Evil Google</span>, they’ve let us down badly, Facebook however... First, a bug in their photo sharing code exposed the unshared photos of up to 6.8 million users back in September. Official comment “We’re sorry this happened”. Second, official fact checkers Snopes (taken on after the fake news scandal) have resigned in disgust. Quote “They’ve essentially used us for crisis PR, They’re not taking anything seriously. They are more interested in making themselves look good and passing the buck. They clearly don’t care.” “They are a terrible company and, on a personal level, I don’t want to have anything to do with them”. It’s like every social media platform has a death wish. Last month tumblr banned porn. This month Instagram rolled out horizontal scrolling, and whatsapp is about to roll out adverts.

<span>[5 Min] Security news</span>, there’s yet another list of lame most-used passwords

1. 123456
2. password
3. 123456789
4. 12345678
5. 12345
6. 111111
7. 1234567
8. sunshine
9. qwerty
10. iloveyou
11. princess
12. admin
13. welcome
14. 666666
15. abc123
16. football
17. 123123
18. monkey
19. 654321
20. !@#$%^&*


And German politicians had a nasty surprise when their personal deets got splurged across the twitters by a user called God. Here’s the funny thing, God’s got nicked now, and has confessed.

<span>[7 Min] Spare a thought for Julian Assange</span>, unless you’ve been hidden in an embassy wiring cupboard you’ll know that he’s been hidden in an embassy wiring cupboard, anyway he’s been a bit fretful since they took away his internets away, so he’s done a press release about all the things you can’t say about him because they are false and defamatory. Literally hundreds of them.

<span>[9 Min] In cryptocurrency world</span> Ethereum Classic has had a 51% attack. Nearly half a million dollars got nicked when somebody managed to roll back its blockchain. 88,500 ETC double spent.

<span>[12 Min] A couple of quickies.</span> The latest facial recognition scandal is Taylor Swift, concertgoers in the states got scanned against a database of known stalkers.

And robotics news, Russia’s most advanced robot ‘Boris’ turned out to be a man in a suit.

And British owners of .eu domains have been advised to get a backup .co.uk or .com or whatever, cos after Brexit they’ll be revoked.

<span>[13 Min] You're listening to BCB 106.6FM, this is IT Stuff</span>, recent listener feedback “I find some of your shows a bit too trivial”. Fair enough. Our pods get cast into the outer darkness at itstuff.org.uk.

<span>[14 Min] It’s time for Anniversary Corner</span> [ANNIVERSARY] twenty years of the Hamsterdance, knocked up from recycled stuff by Deidre LaCarte, Nanaimo BC. original sample taken from Disney 1973 Robin Hood cartoon [HAMORIG] 31 Dec 98, 600 views, a million at end Jan 1999.

Magic happens when you speed up or slow down a sample [DRUNKDONALD]

<span>[17 Min] Youtube of the Month</span> [YOUPOOP] Kinetic Wire Animatronics at Disney

<span>[20 Min] World of Stuff</span> [WORLDOFSTUFF] somebody made a games console from an oscilloscope by converting graphics to vector: runs Pacman, Tetris and Mario, ATMega128 based with sound.

And researchers have used a slime mould to solve the Travelling Salesman problem.

<span>[22 Min] Local events</span> Coder Dojo https://bradford-coderdojo.github.io/ although it still says December, and/or Battle of the Maker Spaces

<span>[24 Min] Go home Elon you’re drunk</span> brain implants, stainless steel Mars Lander & Azealia Banks

<span>[26 Min] To play us out</span> Hamsterdance 2013 & Baby Shark Bombstyle [JANMUSIC]
