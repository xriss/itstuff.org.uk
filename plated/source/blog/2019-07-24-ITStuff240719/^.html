<span>BCB IT Stuff recording 24 July 2019 transmission 25/26 July 2019</span>

<span>[0] Right listeners, let me tell you now where you've gone wrong.</span> You've left your radio on, right, bit of talk bit of music bit of news, yeah? Shoulda checked the schedules. You've ended up with IT Stuff, we do opinionated tech talk, so if you want to bale out now's your chance. Else you'll end up with me and Kriss and Shi and for some bizarre reason Dick has turned up.

<span>[2 Min] We're kicking off with Don't Be Evil Google</span> [EVIL] Everybody knows those scam phone calls about tech support, to do its bit Google has banned adverts for tech support, can't tell good from bad so they're introducing a verification programme (that doesn't exist yet). And Google has settled a dispute from 227 job applicants about age discrimination. Thirty grand each to shut up and go away. Nice to have that sort of money.

And also, don't be evil Boeing. Turns out the software on the 737 Deathplungemax was outsourced to temporary workers on $9 an hour. For balance Boeing say they didn't work on the actual Deathplungeware. So that's all right then.

<span>[5 Min] Mega social media roundup</span> People have been wondering for a while how Donald Trump is still on the twitters considering its acceptable use policy, for example violent threats to nuke North Korea, hate speech etc. Well Twitter has fixed that, with a new policy! Apparently if you're someone important they'll add a warning. The rest of us will get the banhammer.

And Instagram is experimenting with hiding the count of Likes. “We hope this test will remove the pressure of how many likes a post will receive, so you can focus on sharing the things you love”.

Wikipedia cofounder Larry Sanger tried to organise a social media strike for 4th July to demonstrate users' desire to regain control of privacy. He suggested using the hashtag #SocialMediaStrike People have suddenly realised that FaceApp, which lets you age or gender morph pictures of your face, entails you giving a picture of your face to the Russians.

That might not be a big deal, except the Russian secret service (the FSB) has just been hacked bigtime by a hacktivist group 0v1ru$ who targeted a contractor named SyTech and snagged 7 Tb of stuff, including big data scraped of facebook and linkedin, and techniques for deanonymising Tor. They left a smiley face behind.

Two illustrations of how handing over your Twitters to PR professionals can go wrong. The Metropolitan Police started tweeting stuff like “F**K THE POLICE FREE DA GANG” and “FREE DIGGA D ON FOENEM GANG” and “what you gonna do phone the police?”. They use a third party press release service that got hacked.

And MP Jared O'Mara's twitter said: "Jared, you are the most disgustingly morally bankrupt person I have ever had the displeasure of working with” (moar details pls).

<span>[12 Min] Fail of the Month</span> goes to the EU's Galileo satellite constellation. It was useless for well over a week, due to some sort of software disaster on the ground. It's back up now but there has been no transparency about what happened. The emergency backup fail is the relaunch of the recall of Whirlpool tumble dryers.

<span>[13 Min] You're listening to IT Stuff, BCB Radio 106.6 and all that.</span> We generally don't do obituaries on this show - trivia quiz, name a recent exception? - but some recent deceasement is worth mentioning. In the 1960s Prof Fernando Corbató (Corby) took the idea of computing as an information utility and made it happen, interactive not batch, logging in from remote locations, users with privacy and sharing and protected from each others' crashes, operating systems written in high level languages.

And how did the media mark his passing? Inventor of the password dies.

Also, we say goodbye to Chris Kraft, who devised the entire mission control setup during the Mercury and Gemini space programmes and went on to make the Apollo and Shuttle programmes happen.

<span>[17 Min] Youtube news</span> [YOUPOOP] and we have good news and bad news. Good news, they are tweaking their copyright takedown policy, copyright holders will now need to state where the infrigement is and what work is being infringed. Bad news, they have unilaterally decided to ban all so-called hacking videos, it isn't clear what their criteria are for good and bad security research.

<span>[20 Min] Time for our Eco News slot</span> [ECONEWS] a crazy Finnish company (from Finland) is working on cooking up meals from air, water, electricity and microbes. You start with some microbes, electrolyse the water, give them the hydrogen and some CO2 from the air, the microbes get jiggy-jiggy, you 3d print their babies into something palatable and scoff the lot. Yum. £4.50/kg

<span>[23 Min] Go Home Elon</span> He's been torturing monkeys for his brain/computer interface business. Grimes has shared her daily wellbeing routine.

My training is a 360 approach. I first maintain a healthy cellular routine where I maximize the function of my mitochondria with supplements such as NAD+, Acetyl L-Carnitine, Magnesium, etc. This helps promote ATP and it’s incredibly visceral. From that point I spend 2-4 hours in my deprivation tank, this allows me to “astro-glide” to other dimensions - past, present, and future.

In the afternoons I do a 1-2 hour sword fighting session with my trainer, James Lew, we go over the fundamentals that work the obliques, core stabilizes, and triceps as well as a few tricks. To wind down from this I spend 30-45 minutes on an inclined hike at roughly 4-4.5 miles per hour, arguably the most efficient workout.

I then spend 45 minutes stretching before heading into the studio where my mind and body are functioning at peak level, with a neuroplastic goal between 57.5 and 71.5 AphC’s (which is my preferred range for my blood type). I’ve outfitted my studio with the highest grade of red light. It is pretty much 1000 sqf IR Sauna.

Hana then comes over and we do a screaming session for 20-25 minutes while I slow boil the honey tea that maximizes vocal proficiency.

I have also eliminated all blue light from my vision through an experimental surgery that removes the top film of my eyeball and replaces it with an orange ultra-flex polymer that my friend and I made in the lab this past winter as a means to cure seasonal depression.

I go to bed with a humidifier on.
