Ho ho ho! This episode takes us into the 3rd dimension and into video! We're replacing the Mixcloud podcast with a Youtube video so you can see what goes on behind the scenes during a recording, including gadgets and/or guests present. If you'd like to appear in the show, do get in touch! Listen in as we talk about the recent dumping of Thunderbird and the Firefox OS by Mozilla, Wordpress getting hacked (again), Mattel's Hello Chucky, the National Crime Agency asking you to spy on your kids, Grub2's 28 steps to victory, and Peter Gabriel equipping chimpanzees with digital skills before we talk about programmable FX pedals, the art of daisy chaining, the recent Raspberry Pi Zero that came with the MagPi magazine and the rise of crowdfunded micro supercomputers, ending on a quick report about the recent Yorkshire Sound Women Network's hammond organ workshop which took place in Leed's Valley Wood Studio.
