<span>BCB IT Stuff recording 10 January 2018 transmission 11/12 January 2018</span>

<span>[0] Hello humans and congrats on surviving the latest calendar transition, was it seamless for you?

<span>[2] So not much has happened</span>, basically only two things have happened in the whole world since the last show, but let’s warm up with something more routine.

Over in India, Indian Tribune journalist Rachna Khaira reported that the national government ID database known as Aadhaar had got out to the bad guys and full details of over a billion people including biometrics was on sale, for how much? Five hunderd rupees, or six quid as we call it.

For a billion people, life is cheap thse days. Here’s the funny thing, the government denied the database had leaked and also filed a complaint alleging unauthorised access and a criminal conspiracy.  Aadhaar has form, 137 million records leaked last year.

So what do we want to do next? Bitcoin and friends? Electrum wallet insecure, Kodakcoin for photographers (like A Bic For Her), Dogecoin now worth a billion.

<span>[10] And then there’s the big one</span>, Meltdown and Spectre.

<span>[14] You are listening to</span> IT Stuff on BCB Radio 106.6 FM and I’m honoured to announce the first World of Stuff two thousand and eighteen.

<span>[WORLD OF STUFF] There are lots of weird USB things</span>, I don’t know if Santa brought you a USB pair of gloves (hand warmers) or a USB soldering iron or hotplate, well this is a bit less novelty and more awesome, would you like to explain Shi? openhantek.org (it’s down atm).

<span>[20] Another bit of hardware news</span>, why buy a steering wheel for your gaming rig when you can just use your actual car instead? Someone at CCC reported they’d hacked the family cars using a Raspberry Pi and the OBD2 interface to hack the CANBUS and make the car emulate an Xbox 360 controller so they could use the wheel and pedals to play video games.

<span>[22] So do we have any events?</span>

<span>[25] And finally</span> just last week we got announcement of a new Mersenne prime, <b>277,232,917-1</b> which is the largest known prime number 23,249,425 digits.

Printing it at 10cpi and 10cps it would take just short of a month and 60km. Congrats to the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search.

So to play us out we have this musical rendition of Pi known as Song From Pi followed by, well, work it out yourselves. Tarra!
