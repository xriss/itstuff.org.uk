<span>BCB IT Stuff recording 15 November 2017</span>

<span>[0] IT Stuff is installing updates, zero percent completed, do not turn off your radio.</span> With me and my stinking cold here in the studio is Kriss and Shi. Out there in the world of new fatherhood is our pal Dick who is now an expert on hospital wifi. IT Stuff is installing updates, zero percent completed, do not turn off your radio. In this month's Stuff Update we'll be mocking the powerful and then plugging the empowerment of our local events. So that's the usual then. Save you looking at the knowlege base innit. Do not turn off your radio. Eighteen percent completed.

<span>[2 Min] Celebrity guests!</span> Here's Brexit supremo David Davis trying to say nanosecond. [NAYNOSECOND.WAV] and Louis Theroux doing someone's random Louis Theroux Programme Generator @louistherouxbot [HULLPORTAL.WAV] and Zuck [ZUCKNOTHUMAN.WAV]

While Zuck is struggling with that, Facebook managed to get a Palestinian bloke arrested by the Israeli police. He's a construction worker, he posted a selfie standing next to his bulldozer, saying “yusbihuhum” (Good Morning in Arabic). Unfortunately Facebook auto-translated it to Hebrew as “Attack Them”. Also Xmas Is Cancelled, artist Jackie Charley blocked for 'sexual' Robin Redbreast

<span>[6 Min] From Facebook to face recognition.</span> Apple's new face recognition got busted two ways, first some hackers 3d printed a fake face, economy version: someone found he could unlock his brother’s phone. (Woman on plane unlocked husband’s phone!) China developing tech said to recognise any citizen’s face in 3 sec. Back to Apple’s most evil thing this month: can't type 'i'. Last on the evilness roundup, Google, new android 'permission' activity recognition - can't turn off! 

<span>[10 Min] Finance news!</span> Bitcoin is now worth squillions! here's the funny thing, Mark Karpeles who is awaiting trial for embezzling $387 million from MtGox is looking at a $859 million profit after everybody's paid back at 2014 prices. Plague of stealth miners in your apps & browser. Ethereum has had another bizzaro thing. Famous Dilbert cartoonist on Twitter plugging his own get rich quick coin thing, someone replied “sorry pal I get all my crypto finance tips from the Garfield guy”... blocked. Also on the Twitters, 280 chars! Britain’s emergency services celebrated... 

<span>[14 Min] IT Stuff is installing updates.</span> 106.6 percent completed. Do not turn off your radio.
[WORLDOFSTUFF.WAV] Compuserve forums shutting down along with AOL Instant Messenger but https://neocities.org/ “Neocities is here to bring back the creativity and free expression to the world wide web that made it great” - free hosting (crowdfunded) and free software tools, looks great!

<span>[18 Min] Local Events</span>
The games thing has been and gone, any matters arising?
Coder Dojo 3rd Birthday! Anyone from the age of seven to seventeen can visit our Dojo and learn how to code, build websites, apps, or games and explore technology in a laid-back, creative, fun and social environment. CoderDojo has just one rule: “Above All: Be Cool“
https://bradford-coderdojo.github.io/ 18 November 2017 at 09:30 - 12:00
Get Into Tech Leeds - Work experience Jan to April next year, closing date for applications is 17 November, search for Get Into Tech Leeds

<span>[23 Min] And finally security news.</span> A US security research project sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security has announced the successful pwnage of an unpatched Boeing 757. Using only external radio comms they took 2 days to achieve complete pwnage of the flight controls.

<span>[25 Min] IT Stuff needs to shutdown.</span> Whether you like it or not. Please do not turn off your radio or else you'll miss our closing music!
