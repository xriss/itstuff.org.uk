<span>BCB IT Stuff recording 18 October 2017</span>

<span>[0] Hello everybody, Welcome to Negativity Month,</span> in the first half of the show we'll be celebrating the misery of autumn with all the negative technology stories we can find, security fail, and then to cheer us up the second half of the show will be AI and local events

<span>[2 Min] So what's broken?</span> What's out to get you? Spoilt for choice really but starting with broken, WPA2, Krack attack. Adobe Flash, last week proudly trumpeting the fact that – for the first time in ages – there would be no security patches this month for its applications. Sadly, that lasted six days before the emergency fix had to be released. Key fobs on Subaru cars from 2011 and before (£25 worth of kit needed), Microsoft Outlook adds plaintext as attachment to encrypted mail.

<span>[5 Min] Schadenfreude department: </span>Adobe Security Team blogged their own PGP Private key, and Deloitte turned out to have thousands of servers wide open and login details leaked. Gartner, the world's best IT pundits, named Deloitte the world's best security consultancy for five years in a row, so much for Gartner and indeed Deloitte.

<span>[8 Min] Whats out to get you? </span>bitcoin miners (monero actually), WeChat gives everything to the Chinese Govt, US mobile phone cos give your identity in realtime to anyone who pays. Pornhub, advert downloads spyware.Equifax, fake flash upgrade. Mattel withdraws kid-focused “smart hub” Aristotle from market after complaints. "Consumers should know how this product will work and what measures Mattel will take to protect families' privacy and secure their data." Instead of answering those questions, Mattel has withdrawn the product. Data breaches - disqus

<span>[11 Min] Twitter news,</span> theyre doing an experiment with double the size of tweets for selected users, they haven't done Trump yet, er, except someone worked out you can turn it on for yourself. Also they just revised the abuse policy! new definition of nudity! will hide hate images! banhammer for glorifying violence and hate!

<span>[14 Min] You're listening to IT Stuff here on BCB Radio,</span> we're on 106.6fm, listen live on radioplayer, listen again, youtubes, website and all that. Here's Singularity Watch
