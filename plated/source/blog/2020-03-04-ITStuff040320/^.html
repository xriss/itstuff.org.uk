<span>BCB IT Stuff recording 4 March 2020 transmission 5/6 March 2020</span>

<span>[0] Hey hey hey here is your monthly parcel of IT Stuff delivered to your listening device</span> by the err let’s call it Bradford Beck Prime of BCB Radio 106.6 fm.

You probably didn’t order a topical opinion show about information technology, but for the next twenty nine minutes that’s your problem.

Is that passive-aggressive?

I’m Three of Three, and with me are my carers, Two of Three and One of Three. So what’s in our alcove of stuff this time? Well, Stuff is balanced delicately with Leap Year Day behind us and International Women’s Day Week in front of us.

<span>[2] Fails of the month</span> - PetNet feeder devices offline for over a week, and Boeing Starliner nearly collided, and AppDaemon open source home automation software crashed on leap day due to trying to create a date of 3000-02-29. (The year 3000 is not a leap year.)

<span>[7] I see dead people</span>, first, in honour of IWD let’s mention Katherine Johnson. And let’s also mention Larry Tesler.

<span>[10] Copyright news</span> Riehl and Rubin developed an algorithm that recorded every possible 8-note, 12-beat melody combo in midi format, 300k per second, and released them all to the public domain.

<span>[14] Attention Listeners, it is now quarter past whatever it was when we started</span>, but nothing has changed, this is still IT Stuff, this is still BCB Radio 106.6fm, I’m still whatever madeup name I gave you at the start, and for some Ofcom braindead reason we are obliged to spout all that.

And funnily enough following the election Ofcom has now been given the gig of regulating the Interweb. What could possibly go wrong?

<span>[15] Huge amount of Artificial Intelligence news</span> in this month’s Singularity Watch! [SINGULARITY]

- A powerful new antibiotic, or rather 2 have been identified using machine learning.
- Combination of machine learning and computer vision - identifying fake trainers.
- People that don’t exist and cats that don’t exist. Fake people in Porn :O
- 3D Printer resin from McDonalds waste cooking oil - 1L of oil makes 400ml of resin
- The world’s first genetically engineered moth - and they just let it go :O
- Hacking smartphones through ultrasonics

<span>[22] Time for a combined Go Home Elon You're Drunk [HARAMBE] and also Eco News [ECONEWS]</span> this month we’ll tell you what happens when tech billionaires get their hands on the climate emergency.

Elon Musk is in the business of selling us electric cars. There’s been a slight snag in this, the new eurofactory in Germany has had the courts put a stop to cutting down 92ha of trees. But the share price is going way way up.

<span>[24] No more stuff, although we’ll be here again, err, 28 Days Later.</span> hmmm? Shi flagged up for us that there’s a biography of Wendy Carlos coming out, the great sythesizer pioneer. Here’s somebody else’s rendition of the last movement of Brandenburg 6.
