Today's show features cats, fish, gnomes, walruses and Brian! Sixty percent of that list was at the recent Leeds Hack event and we'll have special reports to prove it. We talk about the surprise buyout of Twitch.tv by Amazon where previously it was thought that Google was buying it, we pussyfoot around footie issues, frown upon BBC's cease and desist tactics on 25,000 member-strong, over 4 years old independent fan site, "Doctor Who Media", giggle at Microsoft's patches, get schooled about War Driving, Dialing and uhm, Kitteh-ing and then turn on, tune in, drop out with Grayson Hopper before Brian gives us the down low on the hacky happenings at the recent Leeds Hack event. There will be plenty of interviews from the event in upcoming episodes so you're in for a treat!
