And so once again dear listener, you're listening to BCB Radio 106.6 FM, cos you always do. Fair enough. But, like, you probably weren't expecting our show to come on, er this is IT Stuff, we've got strong opinions about technology, and really it's not an easy listen.

<span>BCB IT Stuff recording 18 September 2019 transmission 19/20 September 2019</span>

<span>[0 Min] And so once again dear listener, you're listening to BCB Radio 106.6 FM, cos you always do.</span> Fair enough. But, like, you probably weren't expecting our show to come on, er this is IT Stuff, we've got strong opinions about technology, and really it's not an easy listen.

Just so you know what happens, I'm Dave, and I've got two little helpers, there's Kriss, he pretends to agree with me and then goes in for the kill, and there's Shi, who's really clever and makes me look stupid, but tactfully, which is like a superpower.

And then we put some music on to let you know it's done. So this is like thirty minutes of buffering really. Up for it?

<span>[2 Min] Let's start with a continuation of last month's copyright mess.</span> Last month it was Katy Perry, this month it's Baby Shark. Let's review the evidence, one of these is being sued by the other [SHARK1][SHARK2]

<span>[6 Min] Facial recognition is all over the place these days.</span>

• Don't join Facebook.
• Rhinoplasty Facial recognition technology in China beaten by a nose job - young woman’s appearance altered so drastically system can no longer identify her.
• The launch of deepfake-style face swap app ZAO has seen it leap up the download charts in China, but it's also raising a host of privacy concerns.
• Not just for faces: Amazon is apparently testing a system that lets you pay by scanning your hand (Orville)

<span>[12 Min] This is BCB Radio 106.6</span>, half of IT Stuff has already happened. Some other stuff that's already happened, here's this month's tech lulz.

Someone called Buspiraten spotted that the people who did the First Bus android app don't understand about private keys.

To make the app work offline, they put the private key in the app. "The RSA private keys to sign the QR code were right there as PEM files in the APK." You want free bus rides? Sure you do.

Tesla reckon they've made a breakthrough on long lasting batteries, they are talking about getting a million miles in car applications or 20 years for electric grid storage.

This has been rumbling on for a while, 5g phone networks will be on the 24ghz microwave band right next to frequencies used for weather radar, so your 5g phones are going to wreck short term weather forecasts.

Free software guru Richard Stallman has resigned from, well everything really, after being caught up in the row about rich dead nonce Jeffrey Epstein and MIT. The same row has dislodged Joi Ito. MIT apparently covered up who it was getting its money from.

Ever asked Siri about feminism and got a vague non-answer? that's because Apple deliberately hardcoded Siri to deflect questions about feminism, according to leaked internal documents.

Project Pegleg lets you implant a complete working Raspberry Pi Zero into your upper thigh flesh it's inches long uhhhhh! it gives everybody around you access to PirateBox with anonymous chat room, file server, and a video of the installation surgery. Reaction on Hackaday: “Totally awesome with a big fat side of nope”.

<span>[17 Min] USB 4 is going to be a thing apparently</span>, will it end the hell of cabling?

<span>[22 Min] Local events</span>, quick plug for Bradford Coder Dojo starting up again for school age wannabe hackers, 28th September, bradford-coderdojo.github.io for deets and reg. This is what cool schoolkids do away from school on a Saturday morning. Way more cool than kicking a ball in a field. Folks, evil and twisted ideas for em?

<span>[23 Min] Go Home Elon You're Drunk</span>, he spotted that Porsche were testing their new electric car (the “Taycan”) at the nurburgring and he got all competitive and said his Tesla Model S could go round quicker and he was sending a team out there bla bla ... well we were all pretty much rooting for the Porsche at this point, but here's a thing, the Tesla turned out, unofficially, to be 20 sec a lap quicker.

And its updated dashboard software is now basically Popcorntime, Netflix and chill, funnily enough multiple pix have emerged of drivers literally asleep at the wheel bowling down the freeway, exactly like you shouldn't if you want to avoid a sudden messy death.

<span>[24 Min] And that's it from Team Stuff</span>, the talking is over but here comes something even worse. Over to Liam McGregor, 2019 Microsoft Data Science Intern:

"Microsoft the Musical" was dreamt up and led by interns spending the summer of 2019 at Microsoft. This Tony Awards-style musical theater opening number is just one of many passion projects that came to life because we were encouraged to bring our whole selves to work.

And that’s what we did: 150 interns and employees came in on mornings, weekends, and nights to create this outside of (and in addition to) their day jobs. Microsoft’s mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.

We hope that this speaks to every person who dreams of being part of something big—and especially to those who’ve been wrongly told they can’t be. At some point, we were all in your shoes.

You CAN, you SHOULD, and you WILL.
