<span>BCB IT Stuff recording 4 April 2018 transmission 5/6 April 2018</span>

<span>[0] Hallo lifeforms welcome to IT Stuff, car crash radio about the car crash of technology.</span> Yep we've literally got a car crash coming up, along with stuff about Facebook and bitcoin and Youtube, World of Stuff and local events. Living the future with us today copresenters Kriss, Shi and Edafe.

<span>[2 Min] So. Artificial intelligence.</span> Self driving cars. What could possibly go wrong? Just a couple of weeks ago in Arizona in the States an experimental self-driving car hit and killed someone. Uber. 'Safety driver' looked inattentive. Another Tesla driver got killed too. Alexa crazy laughing, hookup with Lancashire police “to broadcast crime updates, photos of wanted and missing people, and safety notifications to Amazon Echo owners” & soon to report crimes

<span>[6 Min] This month's other wreck is Facebook,</span> we've been telling you for years they're bad and we don't do Facebook, maybe now you're listening.  Call history, deleted videos. Musk deleted his. GDPR.[ZUCKS GREATEST HITS] It's not just Facebook, Grindr is in bother (what's Grindr) they have been sharing some very personal data, non-encrypted too, their justification was basically everybody else does the same

<span>[10 Min] Coming soon - Porn age verification</span> It can fine you, it can block you ... but it can only suggest you protect data - Social Sentinel suicide terms, 'protest,' 'Black Lives Matter' or 'Muslim Lives Matter'

<span>[12 Min] [NEW JINGLE!] Bitcoin Quickie</span> Crypto Heater Quarnot QC-1 2900€ 650W

<span>[14 Min] You're listening to IT Stuff here on BCB Radio,</span> we're on 106.6fm, listen live on radioplayer, listen again all that why bother even mentioning it? the show's half finished, here's...

<span>[15 Min] WORLD OF STUFF </span>
End of CHIP
Apple New Chip
Magic Leap headsets on the way, demanding that developers keep test units in a locked safe
Oculus Rift outage, cert expired, $15 store credit, who owns Oculus? 
Another day on the nets 1. @RealSexyCyborg asks @VICE not to report on her relationship status 2. @VICE does so anyway 3. @RealSexyCyborg asks to see article ahead of publishing 4. @VICE refuses 5. @RealSexyCyborg tells Twitter about this breach of contract 6. @VICE gets her Patreon shut down

<span>[19 Min] You Poop</span>
Revision Party
Gun ban drives bloggers to Pornhub "We will not be seeking any monetisation from PornHub... we are merely looking for a safe harbour for our content and for our viewers,"
Shooting at HQ - dead person peeved about Youtube stopping payments - Radical Vegan

<span>[22 Min] Local Events</span>
