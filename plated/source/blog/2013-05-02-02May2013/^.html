The show includes:

An interview with <a href="http://www.centreofmanufacturingexcellence.com/fab-lab/">Fab Lab</a> (by Brian)
Shi’s début behind the scenes ‘driving the desk’
Studio guests – John H and Kriss
Book reviews, news, and general tech chatter.
It’s our first show that we have managed to create produce entirely on our own, so that’s a bit of a milestone, and credit to everyone that has put their time and effort in so far!

If you have any feedback, we’d love to hear it.
