Today's episode brings us updates from previous events such as the Saltaire Arts Trail and the Halifax Mini Maker Faire. We've got our usual bits about falling aircrafts, leap seconds and politics before we rant about Mozilla's latest plan to break the internet by banning all unencrypted web traffic, Youtube's war with Smart Tvs, the saga of Windows' crush on Candy and the hot air surrounding Steam refunds before we celebrate a couple of anniversaries; Super Mario Brothers and Windows 3.0, both 30 and 25 respectively - "Happy birthday, you lot." - after which we scare you with the sounds of man made nature, brought to you by cheetah robot, the four legged MIT robot - a new addition to our robot overlords. Mind you, that's a lot of robots. And no, we don't know why humans are adamant about creating things designed to kill us into extinction. Finally, we end with a bit of meaty art bits and a plug for the upcoming Keighley Jelly taking place on the 17th of June. Have you seen Kung Fury yet, Dave?
