<span>BCB IT Stuff recording 19 September 2018 transmission 20/21 September 2018</span>

<span>[0] Hello listeners and welcome to IT Stuff</span>, our topical roundup about information technology. On the helldesk today we have Kriss and Shi, and I’m Toad out of Mario Kart. Today's meditation is courtesy of MhairiMcF on them Twitters who wrote: “'Stop looking at your phone' is the new cheer up love. What's wrong with looking at your phone? I have £500 worth of computer in my pocket containing all my friends &amp; the sum of human knowledge but I'm supposed to prefer what, small talk with random johnnies?”

<span>[2 Min] Let’s start with a new feature</span>, Don’t Be Evil [NEW EVILJINGLE!] Google AI has launched Dataset Search which helps to find open data, and they want to abolish URLs. In both cases they’re imposing their own standard on an existing ecosystem.

<span>[5 Min] On the subject of evil</span>, MEPs just flushed our rights as citizens down the toilet when the European Parliament adopted the outline of new copyright regulations for the Internet. Lots of bad stuff on its way, one of which is mandatory upload filtering. Here’s Shi to explain why. And Amber Rudd, the necessary hashtags lady, wants to use NHS numbers plus biometrics as ID cards.

<span>[8 Min] Disasters of the Month:</span> British Airways “the stolen data did not include travel or passport information” (looks like it’s the Ticketmaster gang, same code all over the place); Spyfone exposed loads of selfies, text messages, audio recordings, contacts, location, hashed passwords and logins, Facebook messages in an unsecured Amazon S3 bucket. Terabytes of it. Twitch got some accounts muddled up.

Plus “Dear valued customers. Chicken wings and cheesy crust are currently out of stock due to a recent cyberattack which has affected imports. We apologise for the inconvenience”

<span>[11 Min] Money news</span>, quick look at how Bitcoin's doing; it's lost 80% from its peak lol. Some teevee guy from Dragons Den just bought some bits of Poor Dead Maplin and seems to be faffing with the website.

And trillion dollar Amazon is rocked by allegations that its employees will delete bad reviews for a nice little bung, $80 to $2,000. This is a whole ecosystem, there are go betweens (who call themselves brokers) between the vendors and the Amazon employeers, on WeChat.

<span>[14 Min] You're listening to IT Stuff</span>, we’re half done now, you can have yer radio station back in ooh quarter of an hour, ok? itstuff.org.uk is where these programmes got to die. Spare a quick thought for Linus who is taking time out to learn how not to offend people.

<span>[16 Min] Youtube of the month [YOUPOOP]</span> Science Studio did a takedown of a landfill youtube about how to build your own PC from The Verge, let's listen in to an extract [POWERSUPPLY].

<span>[18 Min] Local Events</span> and registration is OPEN for the return of Bradford Coder Dojo, 22 September 09:30 - 12:00 (thats this Saturday morning) at the Innovation Centre in Little Germany. The one after that is 13 October. bradford-coderdojo.github.io. Go and be evil!

<span>[20 Min] [SINGULARITY WATCH]</span> Cashierless stores are going to be a thing. Google Home Assistant goes multilingual. Art news, Christies are going to flog an AI created portrait via French art collective “Obvious”. It “appears to be a somewhat murky depiction of a man in the vestments of a preacher”.

And more Art, coming in November an artist will be putting a 100ft reflective baloon in orbit “This is a romantic gesture in the night sky — a satellite that exists purely as art. It enables us through the lens of art to imagine, even just for a moment, a different future for spaceflight, to think of the past in a different way, where spaceflight was driven by bigger questions like who are we, and where do we come from”.

<span>[23 Min] Go Home Elon You're Stoned</span> (previously drunk) smoking pot on Youtube, 2h 37 min! We’ve been giggling about the time when allegedly a broken Jenkins pipeline caused all the world’s Tesla cars to get stuck in a reboot loop for almost an hour... but when you’re being sued for calling someone a pedo and you might be facing criminal charges for saying you’ll buy Tesla back, what do you do? You send a Japanese billionaire and some “creative guests” to the moon. In the ‘B’ ark.

<span>[25 Min] To play us out</span>, docker lxc lxd Kubernetes, here’s the mighty Fall with Container Drivers.
