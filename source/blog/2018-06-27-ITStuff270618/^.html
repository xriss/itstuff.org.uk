<span>BCB IT Stuff recording 27 June 2018 transmission 28/29 June 2018</span>

<span>[0] Hi everybody welcome to IT Stuff for June, you know how your cpu clock scales back when it's overheating?</span> well that's us, specifically Kriss, Shi, and me, I'm Naomi 'SexyCyborg' Wu. Who am I and
what's been going on in my life since Vice dumped on me?

<span>[2 Min] So how about this for starters. Microsoft really did buy the Githubs.</span> What do we think about that then? Gitlab shared stats on the number of projects being imported from Github, it peaked at 8000 per hour. What we didn't know back then, three weeks ago, is that Gitlab's hosting was on Microsoft Azure (they are now moving to GCP ie. Google).

<span>[5 Min] App in Google Play wants to use phone mics to enforce copyrights</span> La Liga official footy app (Spanish) Ts&Cs make you agree to have it listen for footy commentary in the background, it geolocates you and cross-checks for licences and if you’re in an unlicensed bar it dobs them in.

<span>[7 Min] Intel 'Forgot' to Mention 28-Core, 5-GHz CPU Demo Was Overclocked</span> demo in front of journalists and fanbois, livestreamed etc, but er what are those hoses for round the back?

<span>[9 Min] Your month in FAIL</span> The world’s worst smart padlock: security code calculated from Bluetooth addy, guess the cloud ID, or just use a screwdriver. Downtime of the month: the Pirate Bay, uploading is broken and the rest of it is flaky; and Facebook privacy goof makes posts by 14 million users readable to anyone.

<span>[13 Min] You're listening to IT Stuff, the show where community broadcasting goes niche.</span> And so has the Unicode Consortium, version 11.0 has come out with emoji with ginger hair, curly hair, white hair and bald heads. lol

<span>[14 Min] [ANNIVERSARY]</span> 100 years of the flipflop (patent June 1918); 25 years of FreeBSD, 25 years of Slackware, 20 years of Windows 98, and 25 years of PDF, and 40 years of Space Invaders, Tomohiro Nishikado: “I tried soldiers, but shooting people was frowned upon”.

<span>[18 Min] [SINGULARITY]</span> At MIT they are hyping the world's first psychopathic AI, it's called Norman. They're making the point that if you train an AI on bad data, you'll get a bad AI. So to explore how datasets and bias can influence the behavior and decision-making capabilities of artificial intelligence, they deliberately trained it on lots of nasty images, mostly from Reddit (well, not quite, due to ethics concerns they used the captions), and then showed it some Rohrschach inkblots.

Where a control AI saw "a black and white photo of a red and white umbrella," Norman saw "man gets electrocuted while attempting to cross busy street." The control saw "a black and white photo of a small bird," Norman saw "man gets pulled into dough machine."

Facial recognition in China - at a concert by pop star Jacky Cheung some bloke called Yu was spotted in the crowd of 20,000 having stolen around $17,000 worth of potatoes in 2015. 3rd arrest like that at those concerts, it’s like the video van is on tour with the band.

Let us reflect for a moment upon Mr Meow-Ludo Disco Gamma Meow-Meow of New South Wales, who took the chip out of the local M-card thing and implanted it in his hand so he could just wave at the barriers. They prosecuted him for tampering with the card, and he lost back in March, but now he's appealed and they let him off.

<span>[22 Min] Local Events</span>
badonkadonk (July 11th) and itwrong.space
Coder Dojo Shut until September
Bradford Grammar School student Alex Davies, 14, named UK's best computer programmer in the TCS Oxford Computing Challenge.

<span>[24 Min] Go Home Elon You're Drunk</span> He emailed everybody about Sabotage at Tesla. Then he told the twitters “I am a utopian anarchist of the kind best described by Iain Banks”.
