<div class="script_wrap">
<span>BCB IT Stuff recording 30 May 2018 transmission 31 May and early June 2018</span>

<span>[0] Hey everybody, welcome to GDPR month.</span> chiz. Due to calendar May 2.0 supersedes May 1.0

<span>[2 Min] The wonderful world of GDPR Fail</span> Lots of services shut down (Klout) or block users in the EU. The Razer device drivers (cloud connected keyboard)! Ghostery emails with CC of 500 other users "If a bus driver knows to avoid CC and use BCC instead while you don't, I would respectfully suggest that you are in the wrong job," same with MPs, university computing clubs, restaurants, shops, writers' groups and local councils. Cross Country Trains email 3 1/2 hours late. Virgin Trains East Coast. What Charlie Stross said about Klout back in 2011. 

<span>[7 Min] Alexa Korner!</span> The owner of Petra, an African grey Congo parrot, learned to operate the Alexa in her owner's Echo smart speaker, and has taken to ordering the virtual assistant to operate the lights at unusual hours.

“First, you're like half awake and ... like, 'Was that a dream? Did that just happen?'" Petra's owner told WKMG-TV. "All day, every day, it's all lights on, all lights off." Videos posted to Petra's YouTube account show her operating Alexa and showing a clear preference for the Amazon assistant over her owner's other speaker, a Google Home. "Alexa, I love you," Petra says in one video.

Portland family -- Alexa unit recorded a part of a private conversation and randomly sent it to somebody in their contact list. The family was contacted by a coworker who stated that he was receiving audio files of private conversations that had occurred in the family's house.

“"Echo woke up due to a word in background conversation sounding like "Alexa." Then, the subsequent conversation was heard as a "send message" request. At which point, Alexa said out loud "To whom?" At which point, the background conversation was interpreted as a name in the customers contact list. Alexa then asked out loud, "[contact name], right?" Alexa then interpreted background conversation as "right." As unlikely as this string of events is, we are evaluating options to make this case even less likely."

<span>[10 Min] Other random fail this month</span> “A question about the GoPro real quick, I’m pushing the button I see a ‘no SD’. Do I need that to record? And if it is recording is there supposed to be a red light on? -- astronaut Andrew Feustel on an ISS spacewalk two weeks ago;

AND What happens when you have a brain implant and your house gets struck by lightning? Woman with deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's. Not much effect actually - TV fried, aircon fried, implant did a safety shutdown.  AND Twitter password change bug.

<span>[12 Min] [SINGULARITY]</span> Welsh police wrongly identify thousands as potential criminals - cameras scan faces in a crowd and compare them against a database of custody images. 170,000 in Cardiff for Real Madrid v Juventus, 2,470 potential matches, 2,297 were “false positives”. 173 real.

The government's investing £1BILLION of your money in this! 8,000 specialist computer science teachers, 1,000 AI PhDs by 2025

<span>[14 Min] You're listening to IT Stuff where your privacy is guaranteed!</span>

<span>[15 Min] Anniversary Corner</span> 100 years of the flipflop (patent June 1918)

<span>[17 Min] WORLD OF STUFF (1)</span> NY Phil Subscriber data “names, addresses, and seat locations for Philharmonic subscribers dating back to the 19th century. The research team is analyzing the relationship between the audience members' seat locations, on specific concert dates in various concert halls and where they lived. More than 500,000 subscriber records have been transcribed and are made available” “To protect privacy, post-1953 subscriber names are not searchable” lol

<span>[19 Min] WORLD OF STUFF (2)</span> “The Jevons Camera Viewer” Low Cost Open Source Eye Tracking uses two $20 webcams and open source software. https://hackaday.io/project/153293-low-cost-open-source-eye-tracking
