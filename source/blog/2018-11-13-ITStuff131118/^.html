<span>BCB IT Stuff recording 13 November 2018 transmission 14/15 November 2018</span>

<span>[0] Hello everybody, welcome to IT Stuff for November 2018</span>, in which we evaluate a month’s worth of progress in the world of information technology and come to the conclusion that it’s just not good enough.

And in that spirit, today we have an emergency fallback IT Stuff, cos Kriss and Shi are on tour, so here is our B Team posse, that’s B for Bradlug, and I’m Detective Pikachu.

<span>[2 Min] Let’s start with Don’t Be Evil Google!</span> [EVILJINGLE] It turns out that if an executive level Googler has been up to no good in the trouser department Google has been letting the bad boys sneak off quietly with their bonus intact.

In the case of Andy Rubin, the father of Android, that was a $90M payoff, a hero's farewell, and keep quiet about the sexual misconduct settlement.

He denies the bad stuff happened. But the cover up with benefits happened, and there were more.

<span>[4 Min] meanwhile Google got zapped the other day</span> with a BGP hijack, lots of traffic got routed via Nigeria, Russia and China, we should explain BGP hijacking. And it's been going on regularly for 20 years or more, because BGP is based on trust.

Usually it's a mistake. This week's case probably wasn’t malicious, because China Telecom simply dumped all the traffic. But previous cases of the same thing appear to have been deliberate snooping. The most recent case in July was Iran Telecom snagging 10 prefixes of Telegram Messenger.

<span>[8 Min] Windows news</span>, oh dear

At least they've freed up their patent portfolio, this is good isn't it? hmm??

And BillG was in Beijing this month at the “Reinvented Toilet Expo”.

<span>[11 Min] Apple news</span>, there’s a new iPad and a new Mac Mini, both still mostly unrepairable.

But it’s worse than that, Amazon has thrown a load of third party repairers off their marketplace, and the new devices are locked down so that they get bricked if the repairer doesn't run special software after each service.

Also, they're replacing devices because of faulty touchscreens

<span>[14 Min] You're listening to BCB 106.6FM</span>, this is IT Stuff, otherwise available at itstuff.org.uk.

<span>[15 Min] Anniversary Corner</span> 25 years ago NCSA Mosaic 1.0 11 Nov1993, meanwhile Tim Berners Lee has been off on one again “Social networks should "stretch" users to be friends with people they don't know”, and news of HTTP 3 formerly HTTP-over-QUIC, QUIC is sort-of encrypted HTTP over sort-of UDP.

It's got a logo -- don't look.

<span>[18 Min] World of Stuff!</span> The C-Sky Linux development board for $6 you get 64 MB of DDR2 RAM, HDMI out, a 600MHz CPU (something weird), a few buttons, 2 USB -- “a slightly unauthorized tribute to the STM32F103C8T6”, it seems to be an old settop box design that's escaped.

And you can use WiFi to see through walls.

<span>[21 Min] Local Events</span>, next Coder Dojo Saturday 17 November, next badonkadonk Weds 12 December, and let’s plug Bradlug Tuesday 11 December 2018.

<span>[24 Min] Go Home Elon You're Drunk</span> and Elon’s had quite a productive month, he’s fired 7 SpaceX managers (not literally), and he's been talking up his crazy tunneling business "The Boring Company is also going to do tunneling for, like, water transport, sewage, electrical.

We're not going to turn our noses up at sewage tunnels. We're happy to do that too." Just imagine a future where you can go into a Bill Gates Bog and/or flush into an Elon Musk sewer.

<span>[26 Min] To play us out</span>, here’s something sad, a team at Anglia Ruskin and the University of Exeter has prepared this music generated from an image of the sunrise on Mars taken by the Opportunity rover.

Why is this sad, well, following the planet-wide sandstorm earlier this year we still haven't heard back from Opportunity and it's starting to look like the poor old love is finished.
